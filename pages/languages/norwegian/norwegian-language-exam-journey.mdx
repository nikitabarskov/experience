# Norwegian Language Exam Journey

I am determined to obtain a Norwegian Passport in the future, which makes
learning Norwegian an absolute necessity for me. In order to demonstrate my
proficiency in the language, I need to successfully pass the Norwegian Language
Test[^1]. The purpose of this page is to chronicle my journey and share my
experiences in learning Norwegian.

For applicants seeking Norwegian Permanent Residence permit or Norwegian
Citizenship, it is mandatory to have successfully completed all four sections
of the Norwegian language test, namely oral, listening, reading, and written
presentation. The minimum required level is A2 for the Permanent Residence[^2]
permit and B1 for citizenship[^3].

## Starting Point

As of May 21st, 2023, I have made the decision to dedicate the coming months
to prepare for the Norwegian Language Test with the goal of achieving a B1 level
proficiency. However, my ambitions extend beyond simply proving my language
skills at the B1 level. I recognize the practical value of Norwegian in both my
personal life and career, and I have a genuine desire to explore and learn
something new.

To provide some context, here are my starting points:

1. I have invested a significant amount of time on Duolingo for learning
   Norwegian.
2. I have attempted to study with a Norwegian tutor on iTalki.
3. I have participated in a sponsored course to enhance my language skills.
4. I have utilized recommended learning materials to improve my understanding.

While I am able to engage in conversations, my vocabulary remains limited, and
I tend to make mistakes while speaking.

Now, my focus is on improving, and I am fortunate to have access to excellent
learning tools that can assist me in my language journey.

The Norwegian Language Exam comprises the following components:

- Reading test (up to 75 minutes)
- Listening test (30-60 minutes)
- Writing test (90 minutes for A1-A2 and A2-B1, 120 minutes for B1-B2)
- Oral test (20-30 minutes)

My primary areas of focus will be on these specific aspects. I have sought
advice from ChatGPT to provide me with some guidance on how to proceed.

        To enhance my reading skills in Norwegian, I will prioritize reading
        various types of texts such as news articles, short stories, and online
        blogs.

        - Read two to three articles every week from news websites.
        - Familiarize myself with skimming and scanning techniques.
        - Improve my comprehension by answering questions related to the texts
          I read.
        - Expand my vocabulary by regularly learning and reviewing new words and
          phrases.

        To improve my listening skills in Norwegian, I will engage with a
        variety of audio materials, including podcasts, news broadcasts,
        and online videos.

        - Start by listening to the podcast [Spr√•ktalk][spraktalk-podcast].
        - Practice understanding spoken instructions, conversations, and
          dialogues by listening to audio exercises and answering
          comprehension questions.
        - Utilize Duolingo and Anki to incorporate listening exercises and
          reinforce my understanding of spoken Norwegian.

        To enhance my writing skills in Norwegian, I will make it a habit to
        write regularly.

        - Write summaries of the articles I read and podcast episodes I listen
          to.
        - Pay careful attention to grammar, sentence structure, and spelling
          while writing.
        - Find a reliable resource to study Norwegian grammar.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        To improve my ability to speak Norwegian at work, I will incorporate
        speaking practice into my language learning routine.

        - When reading articles, I will read them aloud at home and record
          myself.
        - Similarly, when writing summaries, I will read them aloud to further
          reinforce my speaking skills and ensure clarity in my pronunciation.
        - If available, I will also seek out transcriptions of podcast episodes.
        - In addition to these practices, I will dedicate specific time and
          attention to improving my pronunciation.
