# Languages

Despite being a native Russian speaker, I have always nurtured a strong desire
to learn different languages. At present, I have attained fluency in two
languages:

- Russian
- English

Residing in Norway has served as a driving force for me to learn Norwegian. I am
actively documenting my language learning journey with the ultimate objective of
successfully passing the Norwegian Language Exam. You can track my progress and

Regarding my German proficiency, although I studied it for eight years, my
current level only allows me to comprehend simple texts and express basic
phrases. However, I am enthusiastic about rekindling my passion for the language
and embarking on a renewed study of German.
